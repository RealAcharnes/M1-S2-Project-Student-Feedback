All the conditions for creating an account are explained during creation if you do not comply with them.

The first and last name must be between 3 and 50 characters long, the email must be valid and the password must be between 6 and 50 characters long for security reasons.

A validation email will be sent to the email address, you must click on the link in this email to activate the account and be able to connect.

### Teacher features

### Administrator features

#### Create an account (for administrator and teacher)
